### About me:
Recently I started trying to lead a healthy lifestyle. I am also quite sociable, I think it will be easy to find a common language with me. I also like to play the guitar sometimes. After much thought, I realized that I want to work in the IT field. So, my goal is to get the necessary skills to start as soon as possible.

### Skills:
Basics of HTML, CSS, C++, slightly touched GitHub

### Education:
i graduated from "Secondary school No. 84"(Minsk) in 2019 

### English:
After passing a couple of tests in the Internet, i got B1-B2 level of English.

In my opinion, i can read and write well in English, but i have almost no experience in spoken English
